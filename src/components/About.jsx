        As a student who pursued the mathematics stream during my A/Ls, my journey into the world of software engineering began after completing my exams. Eager to expand my knowledge and skills in the software field, 
        I actively sought opportunities to learn at ICET. These resources provided me with a solid foundation and helped me grasp the fundamentals of software engineering. 
        Through self-study and practice, I developed a deep interest in coding and problem-solving, which fueled my determination to pursue a career in software engineering. </p> <br />

        <p>

Motivated by my passion for software engineering, I made the decision to join the Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) to pursue a degree in the field. This step marked a significant turning point in my journey. At IIT, I have been exposed to a rigorous curriculum that covers a wide range of topics related to software engineering. From programming languages to software development methodologies, I have had the opportunity to gain practical knowledge and hands-on experience through projects and workshops. The supportive environment at IIT has allowed me to grow both personally and professionally, nurturing my skills and fostering a deep understanding of
 the industry. </p> <br />
 <p>

Looking ahead, my future plans in my software engineering career are ambitious and exciting. I aspire to become a skilled and versatile software engineer, capable of creating innovative solutions and contributing to the technological advancements of our society. To achieve this, I plan to actively engage in internships and practical projects to gain industry experience. Additionally, I aim to stay updated with the latest developments in the field by attending conferences, participating in workshops, and continuously expanding my knowledge through self-learning. My ultimate goal is to make a positive impact through my work, utilizing my skills to solve real-world problems and contribute to the ever-evolving software engineering landscape.
